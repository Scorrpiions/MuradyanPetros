Introduction
Welcome to the Observer Pattern Implementation project! In this repository, you'll find an implementation of the Observer design pattern in Java. This README serves as your guide to understanding the project and its components.
What is the Observer Pattern?
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes. This pattern enables a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing multiple observers to react to changes in the subject.

Why Use the Observer Pattern?

Loose Coupling: The Observer pattern promotes loose coupling between objects, as observers are only dependent on the subject's interface, not its implementation.
Flexibility: It allows for dynamic relationships between objects, as observers can be added or removed at runtime.
Decentralized Control: Observers have no knowledge of each other, reducing dependencies and promoting modular design.
Implementation Details

Classes:
Subject: Interface defining methods for registering, removing, and notifying observers.
ConcreteSubject: Concrete implementation of the Subject interface, maintaining a list of observers and notifying them of state changes.
Observer: Interface defining the update method to be implemented by concrete observers.
ConcreteObserver: Concrete implementation of the Observer interface, reacting to state changes in the subject.

How to Use?

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the src directory.
Compile the Java files using your preferred compiler.
Run the ObserverPatternTest class to execute the unit test.
Unit Test
The unit test validates the functionality of the Observer pattern implementation. It ensures that observers are correctly notified of state changes in the subject.
